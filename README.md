This is a database project.

We were required to implement an erd we did for our chosen project in sql and then build a simple application around it.

If you are going to use the code please note that in the application some pages do have go back functionatlity but without a visible button. You just need to select the table and press esc if there is a table or tab to a button and press esc if there is none.
